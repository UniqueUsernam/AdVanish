    <!--<p style="font-size:20px">AdVanish blocks advertisements and prevents trackers from tracking your browsing activity across the web. You can disable AdVanish on a site that isn't functioning properly to allow blocked content to load. With Big Tech Blocker, you can also block large company's websites and prevent their services from profiling you.</p>
    <h2>What does AdVanish block?</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px">AdVanish blocks <i>all</i> advertisements known to the extension, regardless of how intrusive they are. With AdVanish, there are NO "Acceptable Ads," unlike AdBlock Plus and other adblockers. Trackers that spy on your browsing activity are also blocked, preventing third parties from collecting your personal information and browsing habits. With Big Tech Blocker, you can choose to block large privacy-invading companies and help decrease their internet monopoly. Here is the complete list of blocked content:</p>
    <ul style="background-color:green;">
      <li style="font-size:20px;">Online advertisements</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px">Browsing activity trackers</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px">Online profiling (collecting personal information about you from your Internet habits)</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px">Large companies selected in Big Tech Blocker (Twitter and Instagram are blocked by default)</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px">Websites that are built to track you will appear blank</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px">Online analytics and website usage statistics</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px">Other privacy-violating content</li>
    </ul>
