      <h1 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:40px">AdVanish: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
      <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px">Can I override a blocked website?</h2>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">No, you cannot directly override a blocked website. To access a blocked advertising or tracking domain, you can disable AdVanish, but doing so may harm your online privacy.</p>
      <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px">Does AdVanish hide my online activity from my ISP or the government?</h2>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">AdVanish is not a tool for hiding your activity from your Internet Service Provider (ISP), or the government. To do this, you should use a VPN or the <a href="https://torproject.org" target="_blank" style="color:blue" rel="noreferrer">Tor Browser</a>. AdVanish does hide your activity from common web trackers, however.</p>
      <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px">Does AdVanish protect against privacy-invading content?</h2>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">Yes! AdVanish blocks third-party ads and some trackers.</p>
      <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px">Does AdVanish block adult content?</h2>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">AdVanish is not programmed to block adult or inappropriate content. AdVanish can only block inapporpriate advertisements and popups. If you are worried about adult content, you can use the Safe Search feature of many search engines, or install a different program.</p>
      <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px">How does AdVanish work behind the scenes?</h2>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">AdVanish injects a content script, or a program that runs on the website you're visiting, into every website you open. The script removes advertising widgets and content, removes "Turn off your Adblocker" popups and advertising popups when they appear, and redirects advertising and some tracking domains to a blocked page. Websites blocked by Heavy Blocking also show a special screen. Heavy Blocking uses a different blocking method, which you can learn more about on the <a href="heavyBlocking.html" target="_self" style="color:blue" rel="noreferrer">Heavy Blocking page</a>.<br/>The content script (and Heavy Blocking) don't track the details of the website you're visiting. The content script only watches the different parts of the page to block new advertising popups when they appear and stop new ads from loading on the page, and Heavy Blocking doesn't even do that. Nothing about the pages you visit is ever sent to the developers, or any third parties. That information only stays on your computer while you're on that website, and it isn't transmitted <i>anywhere</i>.
