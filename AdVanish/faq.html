      <h1 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:40px">AdVanish: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
      <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px">What large tracking companies can Big Tech Blocker protect you from?</h2>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;"><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank" style="color:blue" rel="noreferrer">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" style="color:blue" rel="noreferrer">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank" style="color:blue" rel="noreferrer">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" style="color:blue" rel="noreferrer">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank" style="color:blue" rel="noreferrer">Pintrest</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" style="color:blue" rel="noreferrer">Microsoft</a>, <a onclick="openTwitter();" target="_blank" style="color:blue; cursor:pointer;" rel="noreferrer"><u>Twitter</u></a>, <a onclick="openInstagram();" target="_blank" style="color:blue; cursor:pointer;" rel="noreferrer"><u>Instagram</u></a>, <a href="TikTok" target="_blank" style="color:blue" rel="noreferrer">TikTok</a>, and <a href="https://www.telagram.org/" target="_blank" style="color:blue" rel="noreferrer">Telagram</a> can all be blocked by Big Tech Blocker. Any services related to these companies will be blocked when that company is blocked; for example, blocking Apple will also block iCloud, and blocking Microsoft will also block OneDrive. Large tracking companies such as DoubleClick are blocked automatically, and are not shown in the Big Tech Blocker menu.</p>
      <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px">Can I override a blocked website?</h2>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">If the website is on the Big Tech Blocker list, you can easily disable it in the Big Tech Blocker menu. Otherwise, you can disable AdVanish to access it.</p>
      <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px">Does AdVanish hide my online activity from my ISP or the government?</h2>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">AdVanish is not a tool for hiding your activity from your Internet Service Provider (ISP), or the government. To do this, you should use a VPN or the <a href="https://torproject.org" target="_blank" style="color:blue" rel="noreferrer">Tor Browser</a>. AdVanish does hide your activity from some trackers and tech giants, however.</p>
      <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px">Does AdVanish protect against privacy-invading content?</h2>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">Yes! AdVanish blocks third-party ads and some trackers, as well as large privacy-indading companies such as Instagram and Twitter through Big Tech Blocker.</p>
      <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px">Does AdVanish block adult content?</h2>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">AdVanish is not programmed to block adult or inappropriate content. AdVanish can only block inapporpriate advertisements and popups. If you are worried about adult content, you can use the Safe Search feature of many search engines, or install a different program.</p>
      <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px">How does AdVanish work behind the scenes?</h2>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">AdVanish injects a content script, or a program that runs on the website you're visiting, into every website you open. The script removes advertising widgets and content, removes "Turn off your Adblocker" popups and advertising popups when they appear, and redirects advertising and some tracking domains to a blocked page. Websites blocked by Big Tech Blocker are redirected to special blocked pages, some of which list alternative services you can use instead of the blocked service. Websites blocked by Heavy Blocking also show a special screen. Heavy Blocking uses a different blocking method, which you can learn more about on the <a href="heavyBlocking.html" target="_self" style="color:blue" rel="noreferrer">Heavy Blocking page</a>.<br/>The content script (and Heavy Blocking) don't track the details of the website you're visiting. The content script only watches the different parts of the page to block new advertising popups when they appear and stop new ads from loading on the page, and Heavy Blocking doesn't even do that. Nothing about the pages you visit is ever sent to the developers, or any third parties. That information only stays on your computer while you're on that website, and it isn't transmitted <i>anywhere</i>.
