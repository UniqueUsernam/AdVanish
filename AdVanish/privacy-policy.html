			<h1 style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 40px">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 24px">AdVanish is committed to protecting you from advertisements and online profiling. Therefore, it would be counterintuitive for AdVanish to collect your personal information, when the goal of AdVanish is to protect you from that kind of thing. So, here's our priacy policy in a nutshell:</p>
      <h1 style="font-family:sans-serif; color: green">AdVanish does not collect any of your data, does not log information, does not track you, does not collect analytics or even anonymous usage data, and <i>nothing</i> ever leaves your device.</h3>
      <h1 style="font-family:sans-serif">No Data Collection</h1>
      <p style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 24px">The best way to protect your personal information is to not collect any of it in the first place. AdVanish is a <i>privacy</i> extension, and privacy is the only focus of it. You don't need to create an account, submit an email address, enter your name, or anything else to use AdVanish. The extension is designed to remove popups and ads from webpages and redirect advertising websites. No data about the websites you visit is collected or stored. AdVanish is open-source, so if you want to verify that, feel free!<br/>AdVanish does not build a profile of its users or collect <i>any</i> personal information, and AdVanish does not use third-party services that will.<p>
      <h1 style="font-family:sans-serif">No Data Storage</h1>
      <p style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 24px">AdVanish doesn't keep any records on your computer or on an external server of anything you do, and doesn't store information about you. The only data stored locally on your computer is your AdVanish settings and what companies you choose to block in Big Tech Blocker. Even that data never leaves your computer.<p>
      <h1 style="font-family:sans-serif">No Server-Side Code or External Devices</h1>
      <p style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 24px">In the interest of total privacy, not a single line of code is fetched from a server. All of AdVanish's services run <i>locally</i> on your device. AdVanish doesn't run any remote code or use any third-party libraries or tools other than basic Chrome Extension APIs. All of AdVanish's webpages (such as this page, the Learn More page, and the FAQ page) are simply local HTML documents (linked with local CSS and JavaScript) stored on your computer, only accessible with the extension downloaded. No external devices play any role in AdVanish's services, so there's no way for AdVanish to collect and transmit your data. Again, AdVanish is open-source, so you don't have to take this Privacy Policy's word for it.<br/><br/>While no <i>code</i> is fetched from a server, the list of advertising domains is fetched from a third-party website. This is the only third-party data source AdVanish uses, and it has no capability to track users, because it's just a text document containing a list of ad servers to block. The URL of the remote domain list is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/blacklist/master/adservers.txt.<p>
      <h1 style="font-family:sans-serif">Third-Party Services</h1>
      <p style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 24px">AdVanish does not at any point use any third-party services to do <i>anything</i>, other than basic Chrome Extension APIs such as <code><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/" style="color:blue">chrome.runtime</a></code>. No CDNs, no analytics, no third-party code that isn't a basic chrome extension library. No <code>import</code> statements are used anywhere in the code. The Chrome Extension APIs that are used can't collect any of your data, because AdVanish doesn't give them any-or have any in the first place, for that matter. Furthermore, only a very small number of these APIs are used.<p>
      <h1 style="font-family:sans-serif">No Data Leakage With No Data Storage</h1>
      <p style="font-family:sans-serif; font-size: 24px">Since AdVanish doesn't store or transmit any data, data leaks aren't possible. Hackers, eavesdroppers, and governments can't get any data about you from AdVanish, because AdVanish simply doesn't have anything for them to take.<p>
