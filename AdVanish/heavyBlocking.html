      <h1 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:40px">AdVanish: Heavy Blocking</h1>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">AdVanish normally uses a special script to remove ads from the pages you visit. This will block most advertisements you'd see on the web. But some advertisers specifically program their ads to evade adblockers. These ads hide from AdVanish's ad-removing algorithm and get past its privacy protections to track you across the web and clutter the websites you visit with annoying banners, boxes, and popups. That's where Heavy Blocking comes in.<br/><br/>Heavy Blocking is a feature of AdVanish that weeds out the most high-risk and sneaky advertisements, then blocks them at their roots. Because of the way Heavy Blocking works, none of online advertisers' adblocker evasion techniques can bypass Heavy Blocking. Heavy Blocking can block ads and entire websites. When content is blocked by Heavy Blocking, a special yellow page is shown.</p>

      <h1 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:40px">How Heavy Blocking Works</h1>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">Normally, AdVanish checks every page you visit for iFrames and other widgets that are loaded from an advertising website, then removes those iFrames and widgets (without knowing anything about the pages you visit online). But some advertiers load their ads before AdVanish's script loads, and even before the page itself does (these are called interstitial ads). When this happens, AdVanish doesn't have enough time to block the advertisement. Other techniques for hiding from adblockers like AdVanish are using obscure, rare types of widgets that are not commonly blocked. These ads aren't detected by most adblockers. But AdVanish has a solution: Heavy Blocking.<br/><br/>AdVanish's Heavy Blocking feature doesn't use a script that runs on any specific web page. Heavy Blocking blocks every type of widget, no matter how arcane. Ads can't load before Heavy Blocking can block them because Heavy Blocking runs before <i>everything</i> else does, at the browser level.<br/><br/>Heavy Blocking relies on a list of high-risk evasive advertising domains to block at their roots. Instead of removing ads from a specific page, Heavy Blocking prevents advertising domains in that list from loading anything anywhere in the browser. Ads are loaded from advertising websites, so the advertising websites that use adblocker-evading techniques are blocked everywhere and replaced by a blocked page. All content, including those rare types of advertising widgets, are blocked if they come from an advertising domain on AdVanish's Heavy Blocking list. As advertisements evolve, adblockers need to too. And with Heavy Blocking, AdVanish has.</p>
