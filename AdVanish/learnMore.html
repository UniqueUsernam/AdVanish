      <h1 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:40px">AdVanish: Tracker and Ad Blocker with NO Acceptable Ads</h1>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">AdVanish is an extension available for Google Chrome, Brave Browser, Vivaldi, and any other Chromium-based browser. It protects your privacy and ups your web surfing experience by blocking advertisements and trackers. A tracker is a web page that uses browser cookies or other methods to spy on your online activity. With AdVanish, there are NO "Acceptable Ads." All ads and trackers known to the extension are blocked. It doesn't matter if it's intrusive, respectful, or inappropriate-all trackers and adverts known to AdVanish are blocked without exception. Updates are also released for AdVanish to expand the list of trackers and adverts that are blocked to provide a more pleasant browsing experience and protect against emerging threats to your privacy.<br/>AdVanish removes popups, ads, and advertising widgets that clutter you web browser and distract you from the website you're visiting. Annonying clickbait (those big, juicy buttons you just <i>have</i> to press), popups, and online ads are all blocked by AdVanish. No more <i>Subscribe for unlimited access</i> or <i>Would you like to create an account?</i> popups. No more distracting image caurosels. No more clutter in your browser window.</p>
      <br/>

      <h1 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:40px">Blocked Websites</h1>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">Mostly, AdVanish blocks <i>third-party</i> content, or content from one website (such as an advertising company) that shows up on another website (such as Facebook). However, AdVanish also protects you from some <i>first-party</i> tracking. First-party tracking is tracking done directly by the website you're visiting, instead of by another website. If you visit a website (such as Google DoubleClick, or Microsoft Ads) that is a threat to your privacy, the page will appear blank (for more information on how websites appear blank, see the AdVanish FAQ). If you really want to access the website, you can disable AdVanish on that site, but visiting websites that are known privacy threats is definitley <i>not</i> recommended.<br/><br/>However, a blank page is not very inviting. That's why AdVanish uses more detailed pages for the most common privacy threats that are covered in Big Tech Blocker. If you decide to block a large company's privacy-invading website in Big Tech Blocker, visiting that site will display a detailed page just for that website.</p>
      <h1 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:40px">Big Tech Blocker</h1>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">Large companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft control a lot of the Internet. And most Big Tech companies make a lot of their money by serving users ads or tracking their browsing behavior. Google's DoubleClick service tracks users all across the web and generates annoying pop-ups and advertisements. Facebook also tracks its users, and Microsoft has its own advertising system, Microsoft Ads. Google Analytics tracks website activity and shares your data with website owners-and Google. Amazon has its own advertisement system which invades users' privacy.<br/><br/>With Big Tech Blocker, you choose what big comapnies can access your data and clutter your browser window with advertisements. Maybe you use Microsoft services quite often, but you'd like to keep Apple's nose out of your browsing activity. Or perhaps you search Google several times daily, but have never touched Facebook and want their ads and trackers out of your browsing experience. AdVanish can protect you from the large companies you never interact with, and perhaps even ones you used to use but now realize there are more private alternatives. If you're looking for a good Google alternative, try <a href="https://startpage.com" target="_blank">Startpage Search</a>, which gives you Google results-but without the ads, tracking, and personal identification. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> is another private search enine with useful results and no data collection. For a full list of websites that can be blocked by Big Tech Blocker, just open the AdVanish Big Tech Blocker menu, or check out the FAQ.<br/><br/>When you block a company with Big Tech Blocker, any services related to that company will also be blocked. For example, blocking Apple will also block iCloud, and blocking Microsoft will also block OneDrive.</p>
      <h1 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:40px">AdVanish Heavylist, Redlist, and Yellowlist</h1>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">To better protect you from different types of trackers and advertisements, AdVanish uses 3 lists to categorize its protection: the <a href="heavyBlocking.html" target="_self" style="color:orange" rel="noreferrer">Heavylist</a>, <span style="color:red">Redlist</span>, and <span style="color:yellow">Yellowlist</span>. Different tracking and advertising domains are put in different categories based on their risk compared to their usefulness. This means a large ad network that is known for evading adblockers would be put on the <a href="heavyBlocking.html" target="_self" style="color:blue" rel="noreferrer">Heavylist</a> because of its risk. On the other hand, a popular website used by thousands of users that offers tracking technology as one of its many services would be placed on the yellowlist because of its usefulness-AdVanish isn't meant to restrict access to useful Internet services. However, you will still be protected from that website's tracking sections.<br/><br/>Yellowlisted websites aren't "Acceptable Ads." In fact, advertisements from yellowlisted websites are still blocked. The yellowlist is just a way to ensure that AdVanish doesn't block Internet services users love just because they use some tracking technologies. Instead, thoes tracking technologies are blocked, but the rest of the site remains accessible. <b>Most third-party content from yellowlisted websites, such as ads, marketing pop-ups, banners, and videos, are blocked by AdVanish. The only thing that remains unblocked is images</b>.<br/></p>
