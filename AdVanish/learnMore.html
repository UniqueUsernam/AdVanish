      <h1 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:40px">AdVanish: Tracker and Ad Blocker with <i>no</i> Acceptable Ads</h1>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">AdVanish is an extension available for Google Chrome, Brave Browser, Vivaldi, and any other Chromium-based browser. It protects your privacy and ups your web surfing experience by blocking advertisements and common trackers. A tracker is a web service that uses browser cookies, scripts, or other methods to spy on your online activity. With AdVanish, there are <i>no</i> "Acceptable Ads." All ads and trackers known to the extension are blocked. It doesn't matter if it's unintrusive or respectful-all trackers and adverts known to AdVanish are blocked without exception. AdVanish also uses a regularly updated advertising domain list to provide a more pleasant browsing experience and protect against emerging threats to your privacy.<br/>AdVanish removes popups and advertising widgets present on web pages you visit. Annonying clickbait (those big, juicy buttons you just <i>have</i> to press), popups, and online ads are all blocked by AdVanish to help you focus on the page you meant to visit. No more <i>Subscribe for unlimited access</i> or <i>Would you like to create an account?</i> popups. No more distracting image caurosels. No more clutter in your browser window.</p>
      <br/>

      <h1 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:40px">Blocked Websites</h1>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">Mostly, AdVanish blocks <i>third-party</i> content, or content from one website (such as an advertising server) that shows up on another website (such as Facebook). However, AdVanish also protects you from some <i>first-party</i> tracking. First-party tracking is tracking done directly by the website you're visiting, instead of by another website. If you visit a website (such as Google DoubleClick, or Microsoft Ads) that is a threat to your privacy, the page will be redirected to a blocked screen. If you really want to access the website, you can disable AdVanish, but visiting websites that are known privacy threats is definitley <i>not</i> recommended.</p>
      <h1 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:40px">AdVanish Heavy Blocking List, Redlist, and Yellowlist</h1>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size:30px;">To better protect you from different types of trackers and advertisements, AdVanish uses 3 lists to categorize its protection: the <a href="heavyBlocking.html" target="_self" style="color:orange" rel="noreferrer">Heavy Blocking list</a>, <span style="color:red">Redlist</span>, and <span style="color:yellow">Yellowlist</span>. Different tracking and advertising domains are put in different categories based on their risk compared to their usefulness. This means a large ad network that is known for evading adblockers would be put on the <a href="heavyBlocking.html" target="_self" style="color:blue" rel="noreferrer">Heavy Blocking list</a> because of its risk. On the other hand, a popular website used by thousands of users that offers tracking technology as one of its many services would be placed on the yellowlist because of its usefulness-AdVanish isn't meant to restrict access to useful Internet services. However, you will still be protected from that website's tracking sections.<br/><br/>Yellowlisted websites aren't "Acceptable Ads." In fact, third-party advertisements from yellowlisted websites are still blocked. The yellowlist is just a way to ensure that AdVanish doesn't block Internet services users love just because they use some tracking technologies. Instead, thoes tracking technologies are blocked, but the rest of the site remains accessible. <b>Most third-party content from yellowlisted websites, such as ads, marketing pop-ups, banners, and videos, are blocked by AdVanish. The only things that remain unblocked are images, due to images being used for much more than just ads.</b><br/></p>
