    <h1>AdVanish - More Info</h1>
    <p style="font-size:20px">AdVanish blocks advertisements and prevents common trackers from tracking your browsing activity across the web. Here, you can see an overview of AdVanish's features and capabilities. For more in-depth help, see the <a href="learnMore.html" rel="noreferrer" style="color:blue; font-size:20px;" target="_blank">Learn More</a> page or the <a href="faq.html" rel="noreferrer" style="color:blue; font-size:20px;" target="_blank">FAQ</a>.</p>
    <h2>What does AdVanish block?</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px">AdVanish blocks <i>all</i> advertisements known to the extension, regardless of how intrusive they are. With AdVanish, there are <i>no</i> "Acceptable Ads," unlike AdBlock Plus and other adblockers. Common trackers that spy on your browsing activity are also blocked, preventing many third parties from collecting your personal information and browsing habits. Here is the complete list of blocked content:</p>
    <ul style="background-color:green;">
      <li style="font-size:20px;">Online advertisements</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px">Web trackers</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px">Online profiling (third parties building a profile of you and your interests based on your browsing activity for the purpose of personalizing ads)</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px">Websites that are built to track you will be blocked</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px">Ad server domains such as DoubleClick</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px">Online analytics and website usage statistics that monitor your activity on a site</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px">Other privacy-violating content</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What does AdVanish <i>not</i> block?</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px">AdVanish protects your online privacy and gets rid of advertisements on the Internet. However, AdVanish can't protect you from all online threats, such as malware and computer viruses. Below is a list of online threats that are not blocked by AdVanish:</p>
    <ul style="background-color:yellow;">
      <li style="font-size:20px;">Malware and viruses</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px">Online scams</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px">Phishing</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px">Adult/inappropriate content that isn't an ad</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px">Cookies (and HTML5 SuperCookies, another form of browser cookie) store information in your web browser. This can be any information, from personal data to the number of items in your Amazon shopping cart! AdVanish does not block cookies except cookies from domains on the Heavy Blocking list. AdVanish itself never creates any cookies or uses any other form of storing information in your browser.</p>
    <h2>Does AdVanish collect personal data?</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px">No. AdVanish does <i>not</i> track you, create cookies or SuperCookies, display advertisements (that one should be a no-brainer, but surprisingly, many adblockers do!), or collect <i>any</i> information about you or other users. AdVanish does not collect anonymous usage statistics either-no exceptions.</p>
    <h2>Disabling AdVanish</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px">Because of technical issues, AdVanish cannot be directly disabled from its own interface. To disable AdVanish, simply click on the Open Disable Page button, which will bring you to a page in your browser's extension settings allowing you to toggle AdVanish off. This will take effect immediately and disable AdVanish in the entire browser. To re-enable AdVanish, you will need to open your browser's extension settings page (<a href="chrome://extensions" rel="noreferrer" style="color:blue" target="_blank">chrome://extensions</a> for Google Chrome) and toggle AdVanish on, since disabling AdVanish will cause its icon to disappear from the toolbar.</p>
